        This specification defines a mechanism for Web applications to register themselves as
        being able to handle certain specific types of services ("grant wishes") with a user
        agent. Once a service handler is registered, any Web application can then request its
        functionality from the user agent in order to compose the service into itself.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines a mechanism for Web applications to register themselves as
        being able to handle certain specific types of services ("grant wishes") with a user
        agent. Once a service handler is registered, any Web application can then request its
        functionality from the user agent in order to compose the service into itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a Web application could register itself as an image editor. When another
        application needs image editing functionality (e.g. a meme generator) then it can 
        instantiate the image editor as part of itself (typically in an <code>iframe</code>). The
        editor is selected based on user preference rather than by hardcoding it. This provides a
        simple yet powerful component model for Web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This functionality is similar to that provided in Android Intents or in FirefoxOS   
        Activities. However, in order to ship more quickly and to explore the simpler options first
        this specification is limited to a subset of the functionality afforded in existing systems.

      <h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        This section details a variety of usage scenarios for Wishes in order to help define how
        exactly they should work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that all code examples are provisional and use completely made up syntax. The scenarios
        rely on the following loose terminology (to be tightened up when the view is clearer).
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>application</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A regular Web application running in the user's browser, and typically calling upon wishes
          in the following scenarios.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>wish service</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A Web page written in such a way that it knows how to grant a wish and that exposes
          functionality to the application in that way.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <section>
        <h2>Fire &amp; Forget</h2>
        <p>
          This is the simplest case. Here the <a>application</a> formulates a wish but does not care
          about any return value, or even about the success, of the wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical example is the wish to share. The user is visiting an application page,
          finds it most cromulous, and wishes to share it with the world at large.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/share-click.jpg' width="800" height="497">
          <figcaption>
            User clicks the “share” button in order to share this most cromulous piece of humour.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Creating a share button is a simple matter of attaching a handler to it and formulating
          a wish.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;button id='share'>&#128571; Share this!&lt;/button>
          &lt;!-- … -->
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#share").onclick = function () {
                new Wish("share", "text/plain", location.href).make();
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The user is then presented with a list of wish services that she has installed in her user
          agent (or, possibly, more generally on her operating system). Of these she selects the
          “Unicorner” social sharing site where she can share with her fellow unicorns.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/share-picker.jpg' width="800" height="497">
          <figcaption>
            User selects “Unicorner” in the list of services that can grant the wish to share.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The <a>wish service</a> picker requires no work from the developer and is entirely
          handled by the user agent. The list matches wish services that the user agent knows can
          fulfil this wish (this can comprise those installed by the user, but can also come from
          other sources such as system application, a specialised search engine, etc.). Installing
          a wish into a user agent is covered in a later section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The “Unicorner” web site, which is a social sharing web site that the user happens to like
          (here showing how Wishes can help open up the Web to new contenders without having to 
          battle the inertia of millions of authors having to add new buttons to their pages), opens
          up atop the <a>application</a> being shared (with some sort of signal that the <a>wish
          service</a> is related to the <a>application</a> — all of this is naturally 
          implementation-dependent). The user can interact with it and hit “Share”.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/share-unicorner.jpg' width="800" height="497">
          <figcaption>
            Unicorner's next generation sharing UX.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          There are two essential parts to the <a>wish service</a>'s handling of the wish. The first
          part is being notified of the wish, including of the wish's payload and acting 
          accordingly in order to grant it. The code for this is straightforward.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;textarea id='content'>&lt;/textarea>
          &lt;button id='unishare'>Share!&lt;/button>
          &lt;!-- … -->
          &lt;script>
            window.onload = function () {
                if (currentWish)
                    document.querySelector("#content").value = currentWish.data;
            };
            document.querySelector("#unishare").onclick = function () {
                // …code to actually post the message to the site…
                if (currentWish) currentWish.grant();
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Note that the code above still needs to call <code>grant()</code> on the wish once the
          action is completed, even though it is returning no data to the <a>application</a>. This
          tells the user agent that the wish is granted and it can use that notification for
          instance to close the tab containing the <a>wish service</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Return Value</h2>
        <p>
          While “fire &amp; forget” wishes definitely have their uses, it is common for
          applications to expect data to be returned from the interaction with a
          <a>wish service</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this scenario we consider the following workflow: a user wishes to create a hilarious
          meme, and goes to a meme publishing web site for that purpose. The meme publishing
          web site first asks the user to pick an image to serve as the starting point for the meme.
          That operation relies on <code>&lt;input type=file></code> in order to show how wishes
          can integrate with that part of the platform. Then it will offer to edit the image, using
          a wish to edit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, data is returned from the <a>wish service</a>, and in the second case data
          is also received by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application's UI is simple:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/memecat.png' width="397" height="374" style='border: 1px solid #aaa'>
          <figcaption>
            MemeCat — The World's Laziest Meme Maker
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Clicking the first “Pick a picture” step hits an <code>&lt;input type=file></code>
          control, which in fact just formulates the wish to pick a file. To give a better idea for
          how this works, here is how you would get a list of files from a file input type.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" multiple id="uploads">
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#uploads").onchange = function (ev) {
                handleFiles(Array.prototype.slice.call(ev.target.files));
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          And here is the equivalent code using a wish:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;button id="uploads">Upload&lt;/button>
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#uploads").onclick = function () {
                new Wish("pick", "image/*", { multiple: true }).then(handleFiles);
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          These come out at the same amount of code. With the wish we need to handle clicking 
          ourselves which the file input type provides free, but if you ever wish to style your
          file input control then that's a plus because you will need this sort of indirection
          anyway. A positive side effect of the wish side is that you don't need no stinking
          <code>FileList</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that the file input type and the wish to pick produce the same user
          experience since to the user, who neither knows nor cares for the page source, they are
          the same operation.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          For the code examples we use the <code>multiple</code> attribute in order to 
          demonstrate its mapping, but the MemeCat <a>application</a> naturally only wants a single
          image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Irrespective of how MemeCat chose to implement its file picking, the user would be
          presented with the familiar <a>wish service</a> picker:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/memecat-picker.png' width="397" height="374">
          <figcaption>
            The system file picker, as depicted if you let a standards geek create icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A <a>wish service</a> that knows how to grant a pick (of any kind) will return either
          a <code>File</code> or an array thereof depending on the value of the 
          <code>multiple</code> field. Such a service could be implemented using code of the kind
          that follows:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;div id="pics">
            &lt;-- a list of images that can be clicked to select them -->
          &lt;/div>
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#pics").onclick = function (ev) {
                if (ev.target.localName.toLowerCase() !== "img") return;
                if (!currentWish) return;
                var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
                xhr.open("GET", ev.target.src);
                xhr.responseType = "blob";
                xhr.onload = function () {
                    var file = new File(xhr.response
                                      , ev.target.src.replace(/^.*\//, "")
                                      , { type: xhr.getResponseHeader("Content-Type") }
                    );
                    currentWish.grant(currentWish.data.multiple ? [file] : file);
                };
                xhr.send();
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Once the MemeCat has obtained a picture <code>file</code>, editing it is no harder.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;button id="edit">Edit&lt;/button>
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#edit").onclick = function () {
                new Wish("edit", file.type, { content: file }).then(handleMeme);
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          It is simply a wish to edit the given file MIME type, operating on the provided content.
          Once done the edited content is sent back using the same mechanism as for the file picker.
          It is worth noting here that it is entirely possible for this wish to be granted by a
          native application (so long as the user agent knows how to interact with the platform's
          conventions that support such communication).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing can then be supported just as it is in the first section.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Explicit Wish</h2>
        <p>
          It is conceivable that there are cases in which an <a>application</a> may wish to operate
          with just one explicitly well-defined <a>wish service</a>, making use of the wish
          conventions for communication (likely because they are already supported by a given
          service) but without giving the user the opportunity to choose the service (presumably
          because it may result in a predictably poor decision).
        </p>
        <p>
          To take the MemeCat example again, it is likely that the image source should be 
          open-ended, but the service might wish to enforce a given editor service that consistently
          enforces Web meme conventions relying on the Impact font, specific stroke and fill, etc.
          where a general-purpose image editor might let the user overlay her cat picture with, say,
          Comic Sans text — clearly a bad thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making an explicit wish to edit can be done as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;button id="edit">Edit&lt;/button>
          &lt;script>
            document.querySelector("#edit").onclick = function () {
                new Wish("edit", file.type, { content: file })
                      .explicit("http://cool-editor.meme")
                      .then(handleMeme);
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p class='note'>
          It is unclear at this point whether explicit memes are required in an initial instalment
          of this technology.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Installing a Wish</h2>
        <p>
          So far we have looked at scenarios involving formulating wishes from the 
          <a>application</a>'s point of view, as well as how a given <a>wish service</a> might
          reply. However in order for a service to grant a wish, the user agent needs to know about
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways in which a user agent can become aware of wishes that it can offer as
          options to the user when needed. Here is a non-exhaustive list:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Explicit installation</dt>
          <dd>
            The user may explicitly wish to “install” a given application as part of a list of
            wishes. This may happen if the Web application itself is being installed (something
            which can happen in some contexts), or as a form of bookmarking specific to wishes.
            When visiting a site offering a <a>wish service</a>, the user agent may provide an
            affordance for the user to specifically perform this action. Alternatively, it could be
            made possible for Web applications to give users a way of installing them (instead of
            relying on UA UI, which Web developers are often hesitant to.)
          </dd>
          <dt>Remembered navigation</dt>
          <dd>
            As the user navigates across the Web, her browser will come across pages that are
            declaring wishes. While having wish picker dialogs immediately show all such wishes
            would be a bad idea in that it would encourage spamming of that dialog (and even without
            malicious intent would likely cause it to be overcrowded), it can nevertheless be a good
            idea for browsers to remember that information so as to be able to offer those sites as
            options, notably in case no other known service can grant a given wish.
          </dd>
          <dt>Wish Search</dt>
          <dd>
            The wish picker could expose a search affordance that would make it possible to find
            wishes across the Web using a dedicated search engine.
          </dd>
          <dt>Built-in or default wishes</dt>
          <dd>
            User agents would likely ship with a number of wish services that they would
            grant themselves (e.g. the wish to pick a file for instance). Likewise, they could
            have a list of pre-configured services for various wishes.
          </dd>
          <dt>Platform wishes</dt>
          <dd>
            The browser can query the platform it is running on to find out if there are local
            applications that could grant a given wish.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          A wish is in effect nothing more than a Web application that can be interfaced with
          programmatically following a specific interface. A <a>wish service</a> simply
          needs to express a little bit of metadata so that it can be recognised by user agents,
          crawlers, etc., but that metadata is very similar to that which can be used to describe
          a Web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of that, wish services can declare themselves using additional information from
          web apps manifest [[!appmanifest]]. Manifests can be linked in the usual manner:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;link rel="manifest" href="memecat.json">
        </pre>
        <p>
          This entails that any process exposed by the browser to install the wish would work 
          through installing the application. If there are cases in which one desires to solely
          make the wish “installable” then a different syntax (but using the exact same JSON)
          can be used:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;link rel="wish" href="memecat.json">
        </pre>
        <p>
          The JSON itself is an extension to the basic web apps manifest format.
        </p>

          Authors traditionally do not like to have to rely on UA affordances (because it means they
          can't emphasise it if needed, also when explaining to users one needs to document for each
          browser, stay up to date, etc.). If installing pages (in a sense specific to the Web)
          becomes more mainstream, it would likely be welcome to support installation from actions
          carried out inside of the viewport. Such a mechanism is not, however, catered to at this
          point.

      <h2>The <code>Wish</code> interface</h2>
      <p class='issue'>
        Is it really useful to distinguish between fire&amp;forget and return value wish modalities
        through different methods? Maybe instead of <code>once()</code>/<code>then()</code> it
        would be clearer to have it be <code>send()</code>/<code>ask()</code>. That depends on
        whether it makes sense to enable Wishes to behave like Promises in some cases.

      <h2>Future Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        A number of different scenarios were considered for this functionality, but only a subset
        thereof were kept in scope for this version. Those that were excluded, but that may return
        in future, are captured below.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Full Duplex Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Once a <a>wish service</a> is instantiated, in theory there is no reason why it could not
          remain permanently open and remain open to continuous, full-duplex communication with the
          <a>application</a>. The use cases for this are however more tenuous than for the simpler
          interactions, and more importantly the implementation is more difficult to convey in the
          user interface. Because of this, at this point it is expected that this scenario will not
          be covered by this version of the specification. A quick discussion of the scenario can
          nevertheless prove useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          One common application of full duplex wishes is patching together application components 
          that today are usually shipped as a single bundle. Imagine for instance that you two web
          applications. One is a code management system which allows you to track progress, commits,
          etc. on a project you are working on. Another is an IRC client which you use to 
          communicate with your team. Both already have your login information, settings, etc. that
          should not need to be shared with anyone, even through tokens (with  insufficient
          granularity).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can get wish services for these two talking together with the following
          application.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          &lt;button id="chat">Select chat to publish to&lt;/button>
          &lt;button id="vcs">Select project to subscribe to&lt;/button>
          &lt;script>
            var chat;
            document.querySelector("#chat").onclick = function () {
                chat = new Wish("publish", "text/simple-chat").port();
            };
            document.querySelector("#vcs").onclick = function () {
                var vcs = new Wish("subscribe", "application/vcs-notify+json").port();
                vcs.onmessage = function (ev) {
                    if (!chat) return;
                    if (ev.data.type !== "commit") return;
                    chat.postMessage("Commit: [" + ev.data.author + "] " + ev.data.msg + "\n", "*");
                };
            };
          &lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The above is, clearly, a simplification, done in order to give the right idea. But as
          such it could well enough operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that because wishes match on both action (the verb) and on payload
          type they likely encourage a relative proliferation of MIME type minting, as seen above.
          That is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether a specific format should be encourage
          (typically, MIME types) or whether we should just match any string (with prefix matching
          when terminated with a <code>*</code>) is an open question.
        </p>

        <h2>Embedded Wish</h2>
        <p>
          While user agents are free to implement a user interface for wish services in any way they
          see fit, some constraints (notably of relying on trusted chrome) are such that we can
          expect typical implementations to render any <a>wish service</a> in a clearly separated
          context.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is clearly sufficient for many interactions, as can be readily seen in 
          mobile applications that make use of wish-like functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, however, possible to conceive of cases involving more advanced applicative
          composition for which it would be desirable to be able to embed multiple wish services
          inside a given application, in order to produce a more useful whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of such a scenario could be for a mail user agent. It is a truth universally
          acknowledged that MUAs are terrible to point of obeying principles of Churchillian 
          democracy: whichever one you choose is the worst form of MUA, except all the others that
          you have tried. Part of the problem likely stems from the fact that a single MUA needs
          to offer multiple different views on email (list of mailboxes, list of emails, emails,
          etc.) all of which can be done in many different ways, and users do not fit into a simple
          set of profiles that enjoy specific configurations: they will have preference combinations
          all over the place. The combinatorics of the situation are such that the likelihood for
          any given MUA vendor to produce a combination that matches your particular needs are
          negligible enough that we can consider the task impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This problem can be solved by making each component separate, and making it easy for
          users to compose their own client from multiple sources, possibly replacing components
          when they find better ones. We could therefore envision a world in which one's MUA is
          a relatively dumb <a>application</a> that does nothing more than expose the data and
          lay out replaceable embedded wishes for all the parts that make up a MUA's UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a universe of wonder is, however, far enough out of reach that wish embedding is not
          at this point a driving consideration here.
